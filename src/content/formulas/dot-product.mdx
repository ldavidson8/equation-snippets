## Definition

The dot product, or scalar product, is an algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (usually coordinate vectors) and returns a single number.

## Formula

For two vectors **a** = [a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ] and **b** = [b₁, b₂, ..., bₙ]:

Geometrically, it can also be calculated as:

<KatexFormula
  latex={'\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = \\|\\mathbf{a}\\| \\|\\mathbf{b}\\| \\cos \\theta'}
/>

where θ is the angle between the vectors **a** and **b**.

## Interactive Calculator

Calculate the dot product for 2D or 3D vectors:

## Use Cases in Graphics & Games

- Calculating the angle between two vectors (e.g., field of view, lighting calculations).
- Determining if two vectors are orthogonal (dot product is 0).
- Projecting one vector onto another.
- Calculating lighting intensity (diffuse lighting based on surface normal and light direction).
