## Definition

The cross product is a binary operation on two vectors in three-dimensional space that results in a vector perpendicular to both of the original vectors.

## Formula

For two vectors **a** = [a₁, a₂, a₃] and **b** = [b₁, b₂, b₃]:

<MathDisplay latex={frontmatter.latex} />

Geometrically, the magnitude of the cross product equals the area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors:

<MathDisplay
  latex={
    '\\|\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}\\| = \\|\\mathbf{a}\\| \\|\\mathbf{b}\\| \\sin \\theta'
  }
/>

where θ is the angle between the vectors **a** and **b**.

## Use Cases in Graphics & Games

- Calculating surface normals for lighting calculations
- Determining if a point is to the left or right of a line
- Computing torque in physics simulations
- Creating orthogonal bases for coordinate transformations
